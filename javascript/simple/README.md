# Simple JS script example

In this example, you'll see how to to generate a Fuji X client and use it for CRUD operations within your Fuji X endpoint.

## Requirements

1. Create Fuji X account if you don't have one or request an invitation.
2. Create a project and wait for the first deployment to be completed.
3. This example is created for a "Blog" project template which is a default one for new Fuji X projects.

Here is a video that shows up how to set up and launch this example ‚Äî will be uploaded soon üôå

1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to `fujix-examples/javascript/simple` folder and run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run generate` command to generate a client for your Fuji X endpoint.

## Code overview

1. First, a user with 3 posts will be created.
2. Then, we'll query all posts ordered by a title.
3. A user will be updated.
4. Finally, we'll create one more post.

You'll see an output like this one in a console:

```

## üìö Data Admin

In Fuji X web app you can use a UI to view data stored in a connected database.

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Explorer 

Use "Explorer" to send GraphQL queries to the Fuji X endpoint.

For example, to delete all posts and users run this mutation:

```
mutation {
  deleteManyPost {
    count
  }
  deleteManyUser {
    count
  }
}
```
